TC performance : system design question 

Positives :
TC asked solid clarifying questions
TC established core features really well
TC established non-functional requirements well
Businessnames changed ( not end of the world )
TC understands end user experience
TC solidly understands how to answer questions interviewer is focusing towards.
TC thinks creatively of different possible functionalities
TC understands approaches :
Good discussions on geohash vs quad trees
geohash = nearest place/neighbors and quad trees = zoom in and zoom out
TC understands BFS/DFS for path finding from source and destination
Leverages ranking based on current traffic conditions.
GraphDB ( Neo4J ) 
Nearest neighbor/Djkstarsa/A* ( shortestPath )
weighted ( or unweighted ) 
Sourcing of location data :
3PVendor/Government
If done ourselves - Google Cars with pics 
how to store location data ( Cassandra ) ( write volume )
TC gets simplicity of data ( timestamp, long, lat ) with freshness. Why Cassandra ( akin to WideTable ) very Columnar not to indexed ( no nested objects/complex schemas ). Or DynamoDB
TC maps
Imagery ( saved somewhere ) or generative
Store data in quadtree ; service can reconstruct street view / block view.
Saved : satelite imagery / street imagery ( granular ) 
TC understands CDN benefits
Distributed by location / region / other
It’s a cache

Negatives :
TC should review types of databases

Neutrals :

It’s a hard problem since we need to focus on what your interviewer really wants to focus and delve on - in this case, ETA routing and navigation.
