TC makes good justification for MPV and phase-based development on the gathering of requiremnets 
TC asked good clarification questions
TC follows templated structures and is able to attend to different sections under ask really well.
TC has good gauge on capacity planning : in TB volume of 1 year of data retention, and understands that the system is tenable with these data constraints
TC reasoned about email raw data, metadata, and attachment data - and how to incorporate design components to handle such asks.
TC was not a domain matter expert on SMTP or specific protocols but still ran through good thought experiments on how to design an asynchronous scaled sender-receiver e-mail flow with message queues
TC recognizes how to build out from single sender-recipient to a fanout model with multiple recipients

TC address design deep dives really good - failures, retries, extensions, changes in search technologies

Google
Generic GFS
Each Google service runs through GFS ( Google FE service ) and does BE routing
Keep singular for now
In backend servers -> seperate flows : gmail, ___, ____, ____
Intraservice routing

Protocol-basis
Address uniqueness : is user authorized ( to send/to receive/to query the e-mail )
 We would put check stages : 
if answer yes, do in parallel


Feedback - 1 person edits the diagram - let platform team know there’s issues
If boxes change, things don’t persist as well
Sometimes, I can’t see diagrams showing up in RT editor - what’s going on ( I gave a 5 minute extension window )
