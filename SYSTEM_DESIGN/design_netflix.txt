Case Study Question :

I want you to design me a large-scale video sharing platform service like Youtube, Netflix, or Hulu. 

Your primary focus is to ship a first iteration of a minimal viable design out. We’ll then focus into optimizations and refinements.

Emphasis : I do want us to focus on future meat of the question - describe the video transcoding pipelines/architectures.


Safe assumptions
Can work with powers of 10
Can work with scientific notation : e.g. 10e9/10e3 =1,000,000 = 10e6
Can assume 100,000 seconds/day
You can leverage pre-existing technologies and cloud services in place of building all components by yourself and explaining all the details.
