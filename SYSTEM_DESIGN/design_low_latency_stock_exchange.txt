Case Study :
I want you to design me a modern-day low-latency electronic stock exchange, similar to the NYSE or NASDAQ, which trade in the volume of billions of matches and market cap daily.
An Exchange’s basic functionality is to facilitate the matching of buyers and sellers.
Your design can use multiple componentsm but is strictly monolithic and deployed on a single machine to meet ideal, real-world situations.


Out of Scope :
- After-Hours trading ( assume normal-hours trading only )
- Building out brokers : let’s assume they expose API contracts
- Third-party auditing tools sorrounding exchange
- Designing digital wallets
- Options, derivatives, and complex securities. Strict stock focus
- Assume Automated Clearing Houses ( ACH ), Settlements, and other components exist.



Emphasis Areas :
E2E low-latency
Correctness, Determinism, & Replay
Data Accuracy & Freshness
Leveraging of event-sourcing / eventDriven Architecture


Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
