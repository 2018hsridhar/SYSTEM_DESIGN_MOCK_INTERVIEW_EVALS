Case Study :
I want you to design me a hotel reservation system for a hotel chain, such as Marriot International. The reservation system should be highly scaleable.
You can assume you can already integrate with existing payments systems.

Out of Scope :
Internationalization ( I18N ) : Customer Base is Strictly American


Emphasis Areas :
Race Conditions and concurrency with the double booking problem

Instructions : 
Feel free to toggle between the text editor and the whiteboard
Emphasis on diagram correctness over prettiness
The environment is yours to leverage
type out your thought process as much as possible on the editor/whiteboard


Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year

Source Of The Problem :

Template Structure :

Clarifying Questions :

Requirements Gathering : Functional and Non-Functional
CAP Theorem => 

API Contracts :

Back-of-the-Envelope Estimations / Capacity Planning ( low emphasis, can skip this section )

Data Tiers / Data Models / Data Solutions :

Read-Write Volumes :
Traffic Patterns ( read-write ) 

High Level Design :

Design Deep Dives & Additional Talking Points:


TC Assessment

What went well :
+ TC Asking good clarifying questions
+ TC got : focused on room type and a fixed number of rooms - versus booking by room number.
+ TC got 4xx and 5xx errors
+ TC got JSON payloads
+ Client-Backend server communication via HTTP(S) protocols
dont need as secure/structured as SOAP ( using XML ) 
JSON satisfactory
RPC : more internal communications ( internal servers & services )
WS : no RT communication
+ On ask, TC understands that on page Fetch, they can get parameters easily ( params in URL versus in body ) for caching.


Where to use refinements :
TC can define PK(…) FK(…) relationships in their data model, and their general understandings of data modeling
TC can provide the ballpark figures to drive the conversation in their capacity planning
TC needs to study denormalized data versus normalized data for SQL databases. The trade off : network costs with joins versus data storage redundancy.
TC is very new on system design but performend exceptionaly on their second mock interview
TC can work on their diagramming skills to be more comprehensive
