Case Study :

I want you to design me a distributed key-value store that can automatically scale across multiple servers. 
Your design should emulate popular offerings such as No-SQL Key-Value databases ( e.g. Amazon DynamoDB ) or Distributed Key-Value Caches ( e.g. Redis ande MemCacheDB ).

The keys and the values can take on any form, but ideally, keys are plain text or hashed, for performance reasons.
Additionally, for each key-value pair, the key is unique and the value associated with the key is accessibel through the key

Your key-value store must support two key operations :

(A) PUT(KEY,VALIUE) // insert “value” associated with the “key”
(B) GET(KEY) // get “value” associated with the “key”

Here’s an example snippet of the key-value store :
key		value
145		“John"
147		“Martha"
160		“Stewart"


Out of Scope :
Internationalization ( I18N ) : Develop strictly for American User Base

Emphasis Areas :
CAP Theorem Discussions
Consistent hashing ring discussions
SSTables and read-write path discussions

Capacity Planning Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
