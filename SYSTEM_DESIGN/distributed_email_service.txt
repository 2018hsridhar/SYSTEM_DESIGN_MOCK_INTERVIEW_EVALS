These services were created sometime after the initial launch of the internet, which led
to a growth in explosion of email volume.

Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice : SMTP, POP, IMAP, vendor-specific protocols.
1 email address for each user only
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
