TC performance ( design a distributed object storage solution )

What they did well :
+ TC thought about getting end personas using our systems
+ TC starts off with strong first impression on clarifying questions gathering
+ TC thought about constraints : file-size, file dtaa
+ TC thought about business personas ACLs
+ TC really thinking well about scalability ( how much data user needs to store ). TC seems 10% Y-O-Y growth rate ( doubling factors )
+ TC really good at data modeling
+ TC thought about DAP : Data Access Patterns - fast or slow access
+ TC considered pre-empting problems : bursy traffic, ACls - in their high-level design
+ TC was able to strongly answer my design deep dives questions

Where they could use improvement :
TC can focus on gathering non-functionals at a higher-level before focusing on CAP theorem .
Unfamiliar with some technologies
Can refine their time management skills


Presigned URLs :
multiple devices
built on HTTP requests
simpler to implement

WS :
handle downed machines


What I can do better
TI stop sticking to a rigid template : please allow more cognitive flexibility here
TI needs to inform interviewer to not spend significant time on capacity planning
TI can refernce a book or case study but shouldn’t force TC to ascribe to a rigid solution
