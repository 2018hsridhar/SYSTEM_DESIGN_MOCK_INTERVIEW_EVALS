Case Study :
I want you to design me a distributed object store on the cloud. Your solution should be similar to market offerings provided by major cloud providers : AWS S3, Google Cloud Spanner, and Azure BLOB ( Binary large Object Files ). 
Your object store should be cheap and automatically scale and be able to handle a diverse array of large content in the form of BLOBs : big immutable files. 
Support operations like static content on a website, parquet files in data lake, or pastebin-esque operations

Instructions :
- Type in the text editor or the whiteboard so that I can capture more details on your behalf
- Feel free to toggle between the text editor and the whiteboard

Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year

Source Of The Problem :

Template Structure :

Clarifying Questions :

Requirements Gathering : Functional and Non-Functional
CAP Theorem => 

Back-of-the-Envelope Estimations / Capacity Planning :

Data Tiers / Data Models / Data Solutions :

Read-Write Volumes :
Traffic Patterns ( read-write ) 

High Level Design :

Design Deep Dives & Additional Talking Points:


TC performance ( design a distributed object storage solution )

What they did well :
+ TC thought about getting end personas using our systems
+ TC starts off with strong first impression on clarifying questions gathering
+ TC thought about constraints : file-size, file dtaa
+ TC thought about business personas ACLs
+ TC really thinking well about scalability ( how much data user needs to store ). TC seems 10% Y-O-Y growth rate ( doubling factors )
+ TC really good at data modeling
+ TC thought about DAP : Data Access Patterns - fast or slow access
+ TC considered pre-empting problems : bursy traffic, ACls - in their high-level design
+ TC was able to strongly answer my design deep dives questions

Where they could use improvement :
TC can focus on gathering non-functionals at a higher-level before focusing on CAP theorem .
Unfamiliar with some technologies
Can refine their time management skills


Presigned URLs :
multiple devices
built on HTTP requests
simpler to implement

WS :
handle downed machines


What I can do better
TI stop sticking to a rigid template : please allow more cognitive flexibility here
TI needs to inform interviewer to not spend significant time on capacity planning
TI can refernce a book or case study but shouldn’t force TC to ascribe to a rigid solution
