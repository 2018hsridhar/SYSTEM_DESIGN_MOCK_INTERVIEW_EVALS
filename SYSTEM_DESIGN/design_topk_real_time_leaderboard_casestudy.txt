Case Study :

I want you to design me a real-time gaming leaderboard for an online mobile game.
Leaderboards are common across gaming and other places; they display the players who lead a specific tournament or competition. 
Users are assigned points based on task completion and challenge completion.
The user with the most points is at the top of the leaderboard

Example of top10 players in a leaderboard :

Rank	Player	Points
1		hari		10
2		Sophia	8
3		Julian	6
4		Shrinal	2

Out of Scope :
Internationalization ( I18N ) : Develop strictly for American User Base

Capacity Planning Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year

Source Of The Problem :

Alex Xu, System Design Interview - Volume 1 : Chapter X : Design A RealTime Gaming Leaderboard

Template Structure :

Clarifying Questions :

Requirements Gathering : Functional and Non-Functional
CAP Theorem => 

Back-of-the-Envelope Estimations / Capacity Planning :

Data Tiers / Data Models / Data Solutions :

Read-Write Volumes :
Traffic Patterns ( read-write ) 

High Level Design :

Design Deep Dives & Additional Talking Points:





Emphasis Areas :
Performancy, LowLatency
Incorporation of Redis, SortedSets, and SkipLists
Discussion on Redis cache cluster sharding on higher external system loads
partition strategies : fixed versus hash
Consideration across alternative data sources
Map-Reduce Esque paradigms for top-10 individuals








Where I can do better
+ Spend less time on the API contract


TC ( Overall ) Evaluation
TC performed strongly at senior-level expectations

What went well :
+ TC thought about idempotent APIs
+ TC did better at requirements gathering and scoping out requirements
+ TC “drove-the-conversation” better
+ TC really thought about rebalancing server clusters during off-peak hours on asks across different partitioning strategies
+ TC solidly understands rebalancing of Redis partitions in a Redis cluster and did a trade-off analysis well
+ TC made a good high-level design diagram and on my ask, was able to extend and modify it
+ TC solidly understands the data modeling and data tier section of this question

Where to use improvement :
TC can spend a bit more time on the clarifying questions
TC can work more on the skill of proactively thinking of what an interviewer could ( or would ) ask in a system design interview
TC can work a bit more on their time management skills
TC can spend more time upfront on the asking of clarifying questions
