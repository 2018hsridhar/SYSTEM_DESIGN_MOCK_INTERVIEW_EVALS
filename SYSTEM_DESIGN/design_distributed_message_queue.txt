Case Study :
I want you to design me a distributed message queue. These components 
are used to provide communication and coordination in highly scaleable, asyncrhonous systems.
Popular examples include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Apache ActiveMQ
We first start of with designing a traditional distributed message queue, but if time permitting, we’ll move onto 
additional features more characteristic of event streaming platforms.
