Case Study :

I want you to design me a simplified Google Maps application with key features. This service is just like the one developed by Google in 2005, which provides multiple functionalities - satelite imagery, street maps, real-time traffic conditions, and route planning.

Source of Question : Alex Xu’s book, System Design, Volume 2, Chapter 3 : Google Maps.

We don’t need to build out all of google maps - we strictly focus on core features.

Key Notes for Optimizing Interview Performance :
We can save capacity planning until the end of our session, fi desired
Please feel free to deviate from the template order specified.
Feel free to toggle between the white board ( diagramming ) or the text editor.
Correctness over diaram prettiness - I'll lint the diagrams over the session
Leverage powers of 10 and scientific notation ( e.g. 10e7, 10e2 )  for capacity planning.
