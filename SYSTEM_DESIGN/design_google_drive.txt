Case Study :

Cloud Storage Services - Google Drive, Dropbox, One Drive - have grown in massive popularity.

I want you to design me a system similar to Google Drive.

Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service : you can store multi-modal content in the cloud, access across any device, and share the files with friends, families, and coworkers.

Emph : 
Handling of a sync conflict ( between two users ) 

Out of Scope :
Google doc style editing and collaboration across multiple people

Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
Diagram correctness over prettiness
