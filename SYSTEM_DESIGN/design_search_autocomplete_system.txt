Case Study :
I want you to design me a search autocomplete system ( a.k.a. design top k or design top k most searched queries ).
When searching on Google, Amazon, or other platforms, as you type in the search box, one or more matches for the search term are presented to you.
The feature is also referred to as autocomplete, typeahead, or incremental search.

Example : if you type in “dinner” into Google Search, it’ll give you suggestions like “dinner ideas, dinner recipes, dinnerly”



Out of Scope :
- I18N ( Internationalization ) : we build only for an American customer base

Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
