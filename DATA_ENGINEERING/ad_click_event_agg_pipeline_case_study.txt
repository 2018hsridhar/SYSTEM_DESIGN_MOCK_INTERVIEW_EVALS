Case Study : Design an Ads Click Event Aggregator System 
Topic : Post-Campaigns Ad Click Event Aggregator

Digital advertising has taken off as a bigger share of total advertising spending with the rise of facebook, youtube, and the digital media economy.
As engineers, we need to track ad click events to enable us to provide descriptive aggregated statistics. 
These statistics empower us to quantify, bill, measure, and report the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns.

I want you to design me an ad click event ETL aggregation system at Google Scale.
We first focus on ETL pipeline correctness, and then we focus on optimizations.

I also want us to focus on the “meat” of the question in our upcoming design deep dives :
(1) how to model the events under ingestion.
(2) How to compute and compress aggregate data from raw data.
(3) How to get the best accuracy of data under ingest.

Target Analytical Queries ;
(1) NUM_OF_CLICKS : aggregate the number of clicks, for a target ad_id, in the last M minutes
(2) TOP_K : Return top 100 most clicked ad_ids in the last M minutes
(3) AGGREGATION_FILTERING : Filter by different attributes.

[ Your Safety of Assumptions ]
  100,000 seconds in a day ( 10e6 ) 
  300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year ( yep )
  Powers of 10 and scientific notation for quick ballpark numbers and estimates
  Exact figures not needed
  Feel free to leverage third-party solutions, cloud technologies, and open source frameworks such as Apache Flink or Spark.
