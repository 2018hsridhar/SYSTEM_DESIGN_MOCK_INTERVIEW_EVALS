Case Study ( focus on data engineering  for big data processing systems ) :
Topic : Ad Click Event Aggregator

Digital advertising has taken off as a bigger share of total advertising spending with the rise of facebook, youtube, and the online media economy.
As engineers, we need to track ad click events to enable us to provide aggregated statistics. 
These statistics empower us to quantify, bill, measure, and report the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns. 

I want you to design me an ad click event ETL aggregation system at Google Scale.
We first focus on ETL pipeline correctness, and then we focus on optimizations.

I also want us to focus on the “meat” of the question in our upcoming design deep dives :
how to model the events under ingestion.
How to compute and compress aggregate data from raw data.
How to get the best accuracy of data under ingest.



[ Your Safety of Assumptions ]
100,000 seconds in a day ( 10e6 ) 
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year ( yep )
Powers of 10 and scientific notation for quick ballpark numbers and estimates
Exact figures not needed
