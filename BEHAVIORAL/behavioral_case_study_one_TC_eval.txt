Feedback stories and learnings from staff/senior staff/principal engineers above them.
Staff-level/Senior-Staff-Level stories usually entail 
A. Organizational impacts
B. Multi-quarter/year impacts
C. Finding the ambiguous problem to tackle ( the what ).
D. Pairing with Management & Leadership to identify how a targeted domain space should evolve ( the why ).
