Case Study :

We’ll tackle a classic system design question : I want you to design me a shortURL generation service.

Background : If you’re given a long URL, such as http://www.systeminterview.com/k1=t1&...&kn=tn, you need to create a URL with an alias of shorter length, such as https://tinyurl.com/y7keocwj

Clicking the alias should redirect you to the original long URL

Out of Scope :
- I18N ( Internationalization ) : we build only for an American customer base

Assumptions :
10e6 ( 100,000 ) seconds in a day
Powers of 10 for rapid calculations
Feel free to leverage third-party and cloud technologies, frameworks, and services of your choice
300 ( 3e2 ) days in a year
