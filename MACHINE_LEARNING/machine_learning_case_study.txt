Machine Learning Interview ( Junior, 1-2 years out of college )

Templated Structure :

Conceptual Questions [ 10-20 minutes ]

Explain differences : supervised learning versus unsupervised learning.
Explain differences : train, test, and validation data. 
Why does splitting the data matter?
What distinguishes classification from regression? 
What metrics would we capture to measure error and loss for classification and for regression.

Coding [ 30 minutes ]

I’ve provided the following data sets with training and testing data
I want you to code me linear regression, a SVM, and KNN
I want you to tell me which metrics you’d collect and why?
Can we minimize the error?
Can we outperform the listed metrics collected
What steps can we take to improve the r-squared ( or other metrics )? Perhaps collect more features?
