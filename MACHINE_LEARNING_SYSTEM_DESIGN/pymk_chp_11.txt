Case Study : People You May Know

Peopel You May Know ( PYMK ) is a lsit of users whom you may want to connect, based on commonalities, such as mutual friends, schools, and workplaces.
Many social networks - Facebook, LInkedIn, Twitter - leverage ML to power PYMK
I want you to design a PYMK feature akin to LinkedIn
Your input is a user
Your output is a ranked recommendations list of potential connections

Assumptions of Safety
We build only for an American population ( I18N Internationlization is out of scope )
Your system should be highly scaleable.
You may leverage pre-existing ML technologies, algorithms, and architectures. But we will not discuss them in significant depth for the sake of time .
