Case Study :

I want you to design a service similar to Google Street View Blurring Service.
Google street view was launched back in 2005 to provide street-level interaction panoramas of worldwide public networks. In 2008, Google launched a system to automatically blur human faces and license plates to protect user privacy.

Your system should be highly scaleable.

You may leverage pre-existing ML technologies, algorithms, and architectures. But we will not discuss them in significant depth for the sake of time.
