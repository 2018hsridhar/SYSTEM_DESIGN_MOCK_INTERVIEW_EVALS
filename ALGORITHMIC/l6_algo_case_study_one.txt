Recently I interviewed a TC with more than 10 professional YOE and level set them accordingly with a leetcode HARD. The problem be solved iteratively ( recursion free ) with a single data structure ( a stack or a queue ); hence, I think it’s fair game to ask .

How did I prompt the candidate as an interviewer :
(1) I informed TC not to write up the boiler plate for executing or scaffolding the unit tests.
(2) I informed TC  that they are welcome to 
Toggle between the code editor and the whiteboard if they felt that 2-3 minutes of diagramming and visualizations would assist them.

At the end of an interview, I like to ask the TC :
(A) What they think they did well
(B) Where they think they could improve on further


What the TC did well :
TC thought of good ideas and engaged in solid brainstorming of solutions.
TC thinking of pre-order : left->right->root
	reasoned against inOrder and pre-order : leaning pre or post order
	append values at the nodes
	postOrder : left->right->root
TC wrote up serialization method effectively. It’s clean, concise code.


What TC can improve on :
TC should ask the datatype : are they integral or not integral? Can they be positive only ( or positive,negative,zero )? Do we have duplicates
TC comes in with 10 more professional YOE - at a senior level, it’s expected that they ask more clarifying questions to their interviewer. TC can not expect the interviewer to clarify all aspects of a problem.
TC struggled with deserialization approach : how to incorporate a stack and tokenizations.
TC can reason  their Big-O comlexity and pre-empt questions asked : please conjure N and H earlier ( trees can be skewed ) 
TC needs to work through deserialize and solutioning to the problem faster.
TC needs to focus on their problem-solving speed.

Level Setting :
Junior : Hire
Mid : Leaning Hire
Senior/Staff + : Leaning No Hire
