TC notes ( evaluation ) 

'''
Instructions
- Please type out your thought process.
- Focus on getting a working solution and then optimize on top of it.
- Focus on a working solution over readability.
- Feel free to either use the whiteboard or diagram on pen-and-paper.

WHAT TC DID WELL :
+ TC targeting mid-level : they’re an experienced candidate.
+ TC recognized very number agnostic : focus on satisfiability.
+ TC made a really good start to the problem with their observations.
+ TC makes sense to leverage or to think about a graph data structure.
+ TC thinking about constraints : when do violations arise up.
+ TC thought about connected components problem modeling
+ TC is definitely on the right track to a solution by the 35:00 minute mark
+ TC did a good job explaining their code with dry runs on the two unit test cases provided
+ TC did a good job thinking of stress test cases and corner cases ( e.g. single equations )
+ TC caught their bug on the visited set
+ TC did a superb job answering my extension questions.

WHERE TC CAN USE IMPROVEMENT :
TC is on the right track but struggles to see problem decomposition into the equality cases and the inequality cases
TC can refine and work on their problem-solving speed if they have to target higher levels
TC can refine their debugging skills : visited() set on the dfs(…)
